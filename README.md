Here's is where Ectogears guides, 3D files , firmware are located. I will be updating them whenever there's a change. 


##  3D Files

All the 3d files are designed to be printed in resin. They have a very tight tolerance of 0.05mm in the model. Some of them has extremely small details. So, best to print them in resin.

## Schematic and Firmware

The wiring diagram is included in some projects and the firmware i provided are in BIN format. You can download for free and upload them to your project or share them around.

## D.I.Y ?

Yes. All i provided are wiring diagram, firmware and 3d files. You have to do all the printing, wiring, assembling with some elbow grease and brainwork.  With all the various versions and types of packs out there, it's impossible for me to provide a step-by-step pack specific guide.

The diagram and firmware is enough to make the equipments but you will need to figure out how to attach it to your pack on your own. To me, that's the fun of it.
